Game Description
--
This project encompasses all the components of a 2D platformer game I developed in 2020 using the Unity Game Engine. The game revolves around controlling a character through various levels, evading obstacles, and overcoming monsters, reminiscent of the classic Mario gameplay. Within the project files, you'll find scripts tailored for the main character, the diverse monsters encountered, and the atmospheric background elements. Each level is designed with checkpoints strategically placed to save players' progress. On the game interface, players can navigate through menus for accessing the main features such as the main menu, settings, and a store offering cosmetic enhancements and game-boosting items purchasable with in-game currency. These interfaces are being gestioned within Unity Scenes. Despite featuring 10 predefined levels, I aspired to enhance the game's replayability by implementing an algorithm for their automatic generation, aimed at conserving time and memory resources.

Publishing
--
Over the course of approximately 4 months, I dedicated myself to completing this project, immersing myself in a wealth of new and invaluable skills. Eventually, I decided to monetize the game by incorporating advertisements using Google Ads Services, subsequently publishing it on the Google Play Store platform. Unfortunately, due to lack of updates, the game has since been removed.
